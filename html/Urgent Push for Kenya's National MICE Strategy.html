                    Yes, the MICE industry is indeed heavily reliant on the government since itâ€™s an enabler of tourism at large. The industry is faced with most challenges, including lack of industry data, standard procedure, poor infrastructure, and semi-professional. In leading economies, thriving industries are those that have goodwill from their governments, from policy to incentives to spur growth. So, what is happening in MICE that needs government intervention? The key element of MICE is two or more people meeting for business, and if many businesses are underperforming and closing shop the market for MICE shrinks, the government plays a critical role to ensure that the private sector thrives subsequently. On the non-governmental side, they set base in countries that have the most political stability with conducive policies.

                <p>
                    In Kenya, the current regime needs to be deliberate with MICE; as we speak, Kenyan tourism is leisure-reliant, which is promoted by Magical Kenya. In the previous regime, there was a kenya national convention bureau (KNCB), which was dissolved due to budgetary constraints, that was mandated to spearhead the MICE agenda. Below are some of the ways the current government can leverage to ensure the MICE industry thrives and Kenya is a preferred destination for meetings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <p>1. Provide incentives to key MICE players, such as waiving visa fees to delegates attending conferences for free.</p>
                    <p>2. Invest more in infrastructure such as roads to enhance connectivity, expansion of airports to accommodate more arrivals and a national convention center. E.g., Nairobi Mombasa Express way</p>
                    <p>3. Lobby for hosting international events during high-level events. The president may leverage his influence in pushing for high-level international events to be hosted in his own country. E.g. Africa Climate Summit</p>
                    <p>4. Encourage more foreign direct investment (FDI) in the MICE sector in Kenya. International companies that are within the MICE value chain, such as venues, may invest in state-of-the-art meeting venues that can accommodate more than 10,000 people. e.g JW Marriott Nairobi</p>
                    <p>5. Incorporate MICE in its National Tourism Strategic Plan. The Kenyan tourism market is heavily reliant on leisure activities such as safaris, beaches, and landscapes. This will provide a clear plan for the industry outlook and position Kenya as a preferred destination, just as Rwanda is doing with its MICE strategy.</p>
                    <p>6. Initiating National Market Research to understand global MICE trends, delegate preferences, and market demands to better tailor Kenya's offerings.</p>
                    <p>7. Harness for partnerships and collaboration with global organizations such as the ICCA International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) to gain insights, training, and networking opportunities that can enhance Kenya's standing in the MICE industry.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are just but a few. We have seen how the Kenyan government is very critical in the development of overall MICE strategy and industries. A typical Kenyan dream is to surpass our South African Fellow, and our biggest regret is being surpassed by Rwanda.
